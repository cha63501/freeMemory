  <h4>How do you use it?</h4>
  <p>
    FreeMemory comes with a lot of easy to reach ways to perform the memory minimization operations found in about:memory. <br><br>
    1. Using the widget which appears on the add-on bar. <br>
    <img src="widget.png" alt="widget panel" class="centeredImage"/> <br><br>
    2. Using the hotkeys (ALT + M). <br>
    <img src="hotkey.png" alt="hotkey panel" class="centeredImage"/> <br><br>
  </p> 
  <p>
    The add-on preference consists of a couple of powerful features which could help you customize freeMemory.<br><br>
    <img src="pref.png" alt="add-on preference" class="centeredImage"/> <br><br>
    1. Enable or Disable hotkeys. <br>
    2. In case there is a conflict between the hotkeys or any preferred key combo, they could be changed. <br>
    3. Adjust panel height and width. <br>
    4. Set a time interval and let freeMemory perform minimization automatically for you. <br>
